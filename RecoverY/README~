This is the README for RecoverY scripts

INSTALL : 

To install RecoverY, clone the GorillaY_project directory with the following commands

git clone https://github.com/makovalab-psu/GorillaY_project.git
cd GorillaY_project/RecoverY/


DEPENDANCIES :

RecoverY has the following dependancies :

bash version 2.0 or later
python version 2.7 or later
dsk version 2.0.2 or later
Rscript version 2.15.1 or later


EXAMPLE :

To test if RecoverY works on your system, please run the following commands from the GorillaY_project/RecoverY/ folder:

./rundsk.sh example_data/sample_R1.fastq

./recoverY_main.sh example_data/sample_R1.fastq example_data/sample_R2.fastq tables/pre_Threshold_reference_table 1


The first script generates the directory "dsk_output" and populates it with a .h5 and .histo file. Additionally, it creates the directory "tables" which contains the file "pre_Threshold_reference_table". Finally, it generates the k-mer abundance plot "myplot.jpg". 

The second script generates the directory "post_RecoverY" and creates the R1 and R2 files which contain Y-specific read pairs. Additionally, it creates the "post_Threshold_reference_table" file in the "tables" directory




RUNTIME INSTRUCTIONS : 

1. First create the k-mer table with :

./rundsk.sh READS_R1.FASTQ

This script also produces the k-mer abundance plot "myplot.jpg"

Next, pick a THRESHOLD_VALUE based on the abundance peak of the k-mer plot


2. Finally, run the main script :

FIRST, set k-mer size and strictness in py_scripts/classify_as_Y_chr.py 
Strictness is in range (1,length(read))
Strictness set to 0.5 * length(read) works best in our tests


./recoverY_main.sh READS_R1.FASTQ READS_R2.FASTQ PRE_THRESHOLD_REF_TBL THRESHOLD_VALUE



TROUBLESHOOTING : 

Typing the name of the bash script provides information on number and order of arguments
